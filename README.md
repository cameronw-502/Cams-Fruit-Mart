# Csharp-project

Welcome to my C# Code Louisville Project!

For my project I decided to create a cash register for a grocery store. When the program is ran, it will give the user the current date and time and request they push any button to get out of the home menu. Next, the program will ask if the user wants to see the fruit menu. If the user accepts, the program pulls a list from a csv file with the prices. Next the user will be asked to enter their phone number. If they enter it wrong it will let them know that they entered an incorrect phone number. Next, the program will ask how many items they are purchasing. It will then ask for the prices of all the items. The program will project the subtotal, tax, and total and ask if the user has any coupons. If yes, it will ask how many coupons they have. Next, it will ask the amount the coupon is discounting. After that, the program will say the final totals and ask how the user would like to pay.

Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
